# IntakeProject

This is my game named "Shiip" 
created as an intake assignment for BUAS(Breda University of Applied Science)

*How to play the game*
When you run the game you first of all get into the menu
There are different buttons you can press
- Play" button to start the game
-"Score" button to see your previous attemps(including time and date of your games, how many "sheep scores" you got and how long you lasted)
Moreover, in "Score" menu there is an "X" button to delete your game history and "<-" button to return back to the menu
- "Exit" button stops the application and saves your in-game progress
- Small "Sound" toggle is located on the top-right corner of the menu screen
Once precessed it turns off all sounds in the game, click again to enable

When you are in the game your main goal is to survive for as long as you can by evading asteroids
and optionally to turn as many asteroids into "sheep" by using special weapon that somethimes appears on the map
You can collect it by colliding with it

Ship can also shoot bullets to damage asteroids and possible divide them into many smaller asteroids
If you collected an upgrade than you can hold "shoot" button to charge your weapon to shoot a special bulelt that will be turning all asteroids into sheep in a certain range

Initially, you gets 4 health points and you loose them if you collide with an asteroid. Then you become invinsible to damage for a few seconds
Once your hp becomes 0 your ship gets desctroyed and game returns to the menu

Additionally, if you get 10 "sheep scores" your ship gets improved and its sprite and effect change, making your ship faster and easier to control
